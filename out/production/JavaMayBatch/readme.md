**Continue** - skip one iteration & continue other statement.

**Class** - blueprint from which individual objects are created or describes the contents of the object that belongs to it.

**Stack memory** - It is used to store local variables, reference variable of the object.
It is always reserved in LIFO method.


**Heap memory** - It is allocated to store objects and JRE classes.
(Instance variables)


**Garbage Collector** - is used to free heap memory by destroying the objects that don't contain reference.

All three JDK, JRE and JVM are interdependent. 
JDK is Java Development Kit primarily meant for Developers to develop Java based applications. 
JRE is Java Runtime Environment where Java program runs. 
JDK carries JRE as an integral part of it. 
JRE can be installed seperately as well on systems where no developement is to be done and we only need to run the Java based application or a java program is to be executed. The JVM is a specification, and can have different implementations, as long as they adhere to the specs. The specs can be found in the below link âˆ’ https://docs.oracle.com. JRE is an implementation of the JVM.
