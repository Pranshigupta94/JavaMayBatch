package Assignment3;
//Create a Java program for a simple online bookstore. Each book has a title, author, price, and quantity available in stock.
// Implement the following functionalities:
//Create a Book class with instance variables for title, author, price, and quantity.
//Implement a constructor to initialize these instance variables.
//Implement a static method in the Book class to calculate the total price of a given quantity of books.
//Create multiple instances of the Book class and demonstrate the use of the constructor and static method.
//You can extend this problem by adding more functionalities like adding books to a shopping cart, updating stock quantities, etc.
